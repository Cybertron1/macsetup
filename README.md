## What it does

Macsetup simply installs and configures apps, dev tools and more.

## Installation

**Warning:** The macsetup script overrides existing .dotfiles in $HOME. If you want to give this script a try, you should first fork this repo, review the code and remove lines you don't want or need. Use at your own risk!

### Using Git and the setup script

You can clone the repo wherever you want. The setup script will install and configure your Mac. It will copy the dotfiles into $HOME.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Cybertron1/macsetup.git
cd macsetup
chmod +x setup
./setup
```

### Git-free install

```bash
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Cybertron1/macsetup/private/install)
```

### Apps

MacSetup tries to install as many apps as possible with [brew](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew). This allows to easily install and uninstall apps (unlike what stock Mac allows).

If the app is not available on brew, it needs to be downloaded via the AppStore. This is accomplished with the [mas](https://github.com/mas-cli/mas) brew formula which interacts directly with the AppStore. Unfortunately the login into the Store needs to be done manually.
